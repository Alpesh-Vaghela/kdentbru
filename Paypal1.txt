Hello PayPal,

I sold digital goods and service that is always non-refundable to any buyer. 

Because once it's sold and received by buyer he can do multiple copies of it and hence it's not worth to get back that item & do refund of it.

The attached screenshot is proof i sent buyer that item & the email i marked in it is associated also to PayPal.

Buyer was totally agreed on service and good which sent him because he already checked it on my machine & agreed to pay me the amount.

But after successfully received those files (item) buyer thinks he can do a fraud and create PayPal dispute (Misuse the PayPal dispute system) and get refund of amount & money too.

So my gentle request to you please close this dispute in favor of me and set an example for those who are misusing PayPal to do frauds.

Thanks You.
